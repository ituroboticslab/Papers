abstract = {This paper describes a probabilistic approach to the problem of recognizing 
places based on their appearance. The system we present is not limited to localization, 
but can determine that a new observation comes from a previously unseen place, and so 
augment its map. Effectively this is a SLAM system in the space of appearance. Our 
probabilistic approach allows us to explicitly account for perceptual aliasing in the 
environment--identical but indistinctive observations receive a low probability of 
having come from the same place. We achieve this by learning a generative model of 
place appearance. By partitioning the learning problem into two parts, new place models 
can be learned online from only a single observation of a place. The algorithm 
complexity is linear in the number of places in the map, and is particularly suitable 
for online loop closure detection in mobile robotics.},
